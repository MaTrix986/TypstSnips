Typst snnipets for [HyperSnips for Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OrangeX4.hsnips) & Obsidian([Latex Suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite))

# Thanks

Thanks for [this project](https://github.com/KarPhoon/VSCode-hsnip-for-Typst) for darvin's [HyperSnips](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=draivin.hsnips), it provides a lot of useful typst snippets. I made only a few minor changes to adapt it to [HyperSnips for Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OrangeX4.hsnips) & [Latex Suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite). And thanks to two plugins mentioned above.

# How to use

## [HyperSnips for Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OrangeX4.hsnips)

use command `HyperSnips: Open Snnipets Directory`, copy `typst.hsnips`  in. Then use command `HyperSnips: Reload Snnipets`.

## [Latex Suite](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite)

1. Copy contents of `typst.js` into settings of Latex Suite.
2. Or turn on `Load from file`, and copy `typst.js` into directory of your vault.

# Attention

Transplantation may be incomplete. The snnipets behaviour under the two plugins is not always the same.
